== Deploy a REST API

Now, let’s deploy an existing Quarkus application. The container image of this file is hosted on http://quay.io[quay.io]. Quay is a registry for storing and building container images as well as distributing other OCI artifacts. The service is free for those who want to set up their own public repositories and available for a fee if you want to create private repositories

With this, you have successfully deployed this application on OpenShift.

== Annotate the Quarkus application for Service Discovery
In this section, we will

* Add metadata to the previously deployed Quarkus application to make it easily discoverable by OpenShift API Management. 

[NOTE]
====
Service Discovery is a 3scale feature that helps you import services from an OpenShift cluster. The Red Hat 3scale API Management instance provided by Red Hat OpenShift API Management has the https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_3scale_api_management/2.10/html/admin_portal_guide/service_discovery_from_openshift_to_3scale[Service Discovery] feature enabled and pre-configured.

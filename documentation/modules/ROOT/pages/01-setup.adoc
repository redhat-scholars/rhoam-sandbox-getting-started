= Red Hat OpenShift API Management
include::_attributes.adoc[]


As a developer, with OpenShift API Management, you can manage API access, policy, and traffic controls, and reuse existing assets by connecting to an API. You can enhance the security of the APIs and developer portal by leveraging Red Hatâ€™s single sign-on technology.

You will use the  newly launched *Developer Sandbox for Red Hat OpenShift API Management*, which provides you with a private OpenShift API Management tenant. You will also be able to deploy your services to learn how to manage them with OpenShift API Management.
